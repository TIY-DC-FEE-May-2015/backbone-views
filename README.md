## Concentration

Concentration is a card game known as Memory in which there are matching pairs that are shuffled and placed face down.  The player tries to match the pairs by flipping over 2 cards at a time.  If the 2 cards do not match, they are flipped back over.  If the 2 cards do match, they are removed from the game.  The goal of the game is to remove all the cards.

This project does the following: 
*Build a Backbone Views based game
*Keep track of cards that are flipped over
*If cards match, remove from game
*Use setTimeout function to allow player to see cards before they are flipped over
*Use handlebar templates to generated random card placement for each game
*All 16 cards should be shown on the page regardless of window size
